# Multiple Choice Quiz

Multiple choice interactive quiz with Javascript.

## Description

The motivation for building this project was to provide an interactive and fun way for people to test their coding knowledge within the browser. This is a good way to make studying exciting, engaging and interactive and solves the problem of helping students who are struggling to remember a lot of information about coding. This was also an excellent way for me to learn more about JavaScript, refreshing my knowledge of DOM manipulation as well as utilising arrays to store the question information and utilising and executing functions where needed. I also learnt how to use event listeners to create interactivity when the user does something such as clicking on a button on the page.
